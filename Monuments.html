      <h3>Monument</h3>
      <p>
        A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to
        commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social
        group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural
        heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or
        architectural importance. Some of the first monuments were dolmens or
        menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary
        purposes.[1] Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials,
        historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets.

      <h3>Forts</h3>
      <p>
        There are nearly 350 forts in Maharashtra, so it is said that forts are
        the glory of Maharashtra. Most of these forts are associated with the
        great Maratha ruler, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It is believed that he
        developed as many as thirteen forts. Vijaydurg fort is regarded to be
        the best sea fort developed by Shivaji. Every fort has temple inside
        that was a powerful inspiration to the Maratha fighters. 510 km away
        from Mumbai is the famous Sindhudurg and Vijaydurg forts. This twin fort
        was constructed with the special guidelines from Shivaji. This fort is
        famous for its serene environmental beauty and its historic importance.
        Shivner fort is the fort where Shivaji was born. This fort is nearly
        about 120 km from Pune. Pratapgad fort reminds the fiery battle fought
        between Shivaji and Afzal Khan. One must see the 300-year old fine
        architectural fort of Murud - Janjira fort, Lohagad and Visapur Forts,
        Harishchandragad Fort, Arnala Fort and Ajinkyatara Fort are ideal for
        trekking. Adventure lovers must visit these forts.
