                Ellora is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India.
                It is one of the largest rock-cut Hindu temple cave complexes in the world, with artwork dating
                from the period 600–1000 CE.[1][2] Cave 16 features the largest single monolithic rock
                excavation in the world, the Kailash temple, a chariot-shaped monument dedicated to the god
                Shiva. The Kailash temple excavation also features sculptures depicting various Hindu deities as
                well as relief panels summarizing the two major Hindu epics.

                There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri
                Hills, 34 of which are open to public.[3] These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist
                (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves,[4][5] each group representing deities and
                mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective
                religion.[4] They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that
                existed in ancient India.[2][6] All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta
                dynasty, which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty, which
                constructed a number of the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was
                provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.[3][7]

                Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims,[5] the site's location on an
                ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan
                region.
